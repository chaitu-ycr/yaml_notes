    "# Sequences (Lists) 📋\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML sequences (also known as lists) are ordered collections of values. They are used to represent data structures like arrays and lists in a simple and readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic List\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences are defined using a dash (`-`) followed by a space for each item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "fruits:\n",
    "  - 🍎 Apple\n",
    "  - 🍌 Banana\n",
    "  - 🍒 Cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each item in the list starts with a `-`\n",
    "* Items are indented for clarity (optional but recommended).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "You can nest lists within lists to represent more complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "favorites:\n",
    "  - colors:\n",
    "      - 🔴 Red\n",
    "      - 🟢 Green\n",
    "      - 🔵 Blue\n",
    "  - numbers:\n",
    "      - 1️⃣ One\n",
    "      - 2️⃣ Two\n",
    "      - 3️⃣ Three\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The favorites key contains a list of nested lists (colors and numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists of Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can contain dictionaries (mappings), which is useful for representing structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "employees:\n",
    "  - name: chaitu-ycr\n",
    "    age: 30\n",
    "    department: 🛠️ Engineering\n",
    "  - name: ycr dummy\n",
    "    age: 25\n",
    "    department: 📈 Marketing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each item in the employees list is a dictionary with name, age, and department keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mixed Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can contain different types of items, such as strings, numbers, and booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "mixed_list:\n",
    "  - \"String\" 📜\n",
    "  - 42 🔢\n",
    "  - true ⚖️\n",
    "  - null 🌀\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The mixed_list contains a string, an integer, a boolean, and a null value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists with Multiline Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can include multiline strings using block or folded scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "notes:\n",
    "  - >\n",
    "    This is a folded string 📄\n",
    "    in a list item.\n",
    "  - |\n",
    "    This is a block string 🖋️\n",
    "    in a list item.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first item uses a folded scalar (`>`).\n",
    "* The second item uses a block scalar (`|`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining Sequences and Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine sequences and mappings to create complex structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "complex_structure:\n",
    "  - name: \"Item 1\" 📦\n",
    "    attributes:\n",
    "      - attribute1: value1\n",
    "      - attribute2: value2\n",
    "  - name: \"Item 2\" 📦\n",
    "    attributes:\n",
    "      - attribute1: value3\n",
    "      - attribute2: value4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each item in complex_structure is a dictionary with a nested list of dictionaries (attributes)."
