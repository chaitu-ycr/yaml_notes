    "# Syntax and Structure 🧩\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is designed to be a human-readable data serialization format. Its syntax and structure are simple, making it easy to write and read.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indentation and Whitespace 📏\n",
    "\n",
    "Spaces Only: YAML uses spaces for indentation, not tabs. Consistent indentation is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Levels of Indentation: Indentation levels define the hierarchy and structure of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "key1: value1\n",
    "key2:\n",
    "  nestedKey1: nestedValue1\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `key2` contains a nested mapping, which is indented.\n",

    "  * Multiline\n",
    "    * Block Scalar (`|`): Preserves line breaks.\n",
    "    * Folded Scalar (`>`): Folds line breaks into spaces.\n",
    "  * In YAML, `>+`, `>-`, `|+`, and `|-` are used to control the formatting and handling of multiline strings, which are known as block scalars.\n",
