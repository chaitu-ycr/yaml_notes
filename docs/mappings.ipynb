    "# Mappings (Dictionaries) 📑\n",
    "\n",
    "Mappings (also known as dictionaries or hash maps) in YAML are collections of key-value pairs. They are essential for representing structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic mapping consists of key-value pairs separated by a colon and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "person:\n",
    "  name: chaitu-ycr\n",
    "  age: 30\n",
    "  city: chennai 🏙️\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* person is a key that maps to another mapping.\n",
    "* Inside the person mapping, there are keys (name, age, city) with their respective values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "Mappings can contain other mappings, creating a nested structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "company:\n",
    "  name: ycr Corp\n",
    "  location:\n",
    "    city: chennai 🏙️\n",
    "    state: Tamil Nadu 🛕\n",
    "  employees:\n",
    "    - name: chaitu-ycr\n",
    "      role: Developer 👩‍💻\n",
    "    - name: ycr dummy\n",
    "      role: Designer 🎨\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* company is a mapping with nested mappings for location and employees.\n",
    "* employees is a list of mappings, each representing an employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inline Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple structures, mappings can be written in a single line using curly braces `{}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "address: {street: 123 Main St, city: chennai, zip: 12345}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inline mapping is a concise way to represent simple key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complex Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML allows the use of complex types, such as sequences or mappings, as keys. These are enclosed in `?` and `:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "? [first, second]\n",
    ": \"Tuple as a key\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The key [first, second] is a sequence used as a key for the value \"Tuple as a key\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining Mappings and Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine mappings and sequences to create complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "project:\n",
    "  name: Build Website\n",
    "  tasks:\n",
    "    - title: Design Layout 🎨\n",
    "      status: Completed ✅\n",
    "    - title: Implement Backend 🖥️\n",
    "      status: In Progress 🔄\n",
    "    - title: Test Functionality 🧪\n",
    "      status: Pending ⏳\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* tasks is a list of mappings, each representing a task with title and status.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anchors and Aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) allow you to reuse values within a YAML document.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "defaults: &defaults\n",
    "  country: INDIA in\n",
    "  currency: RUPEE 💵\n",
    "\n",
    "location1:\n",
    "  <<: *defaults\n",
    "  city: chennai 🏙️\n",
    "\n",
    "location2:\n",
    "  <<: *defaults\n",
    "  city: Pondicherry 🌴\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* defaults is an anchor that can be reused in other mappings using `<<:` and `*`"
