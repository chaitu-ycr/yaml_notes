    "# Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalars are single, indivisible values. They can be `strings`, `numbers`, `booleans`, or `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strings (`!!str`) üìú\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings in YAML are used to represent textual data. YAML allows you to format strings in various ways to handle simple and complex text scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plain Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Plain strings are unquoted strings. They are the simplest and most commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "name: chaitu-ycr\n",
    "description: This is a plain string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quoted Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Use single quotes for strings that include special characters that should be taken literally.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "text: 'It''s a sunny day'  # Escapes single quote\n",
    "emoji: 'üòÄüòÉüòÑ'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use double quotes for strings that include special characters or need to include escape sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "text: \"Hello, \\nWorld!\"  # \\n creates a newline\n",
    "emoji: \"üòÄüòÉüòÑ\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiline Strings üñãÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML supports multiline strings using block (`|`) and folded (`>`) styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "block_scalar: |\n",
    "  This is a block scalar.\n",
    "  It preserves line breaks.\n",
    "  Even empty lines are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "folded_scalar: >\n",
    "  This is a folded scalar.\n",
    "  It folds new lines into spaces,\n",
    "  creating a single flowing paragraph.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Characters and Escaping üîç\n",
    "\n",
    "Double-quoted strings can contain special characters and escape sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use backslash (`\\`) to introduce escape sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "special_characters: \"Newline: \\n, Tab: \\t, Backslash: \\\\, Quote: \\\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null Strings üåÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "Null values are represented as (`null`) or `(~)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "null_example1: null\n",
    "null_example2: ~\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numbers (`!!int`, `!!float`) üî¢\n",
    "\n",
    "YAML supports different types of numbers, including integers, floating-point numbers, and numbers in scientific notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "example\n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "# An integer representing age\n",
    "age: 30\n",
    "\n",
    "# A negative integer representing temperature\n",
    "temperature: -5\n",
    "\n",
    "# A float representing height in feet\n",
    "height: 5.9\n",
    "\n",
    "# Speed of light in meters per second\n",
    "speed_of_light: 3.0e8\n",
    "\n",
    "# A hexadecimal color code\n",
    "color_code: 0xFF5733\n",
    "\n",
    "# File permission notation\n",
    "file_permissions: 0755\n",
    "\n",
    "# A binary number\n",
    "binary_value: 0b101010\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Booleans (`!!bool`) ‚öñÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans in YAML are used to represent true or false values. They are essential for controlling logic and conditions within your YAML files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* True Values: `true`, `True`, `TRUE`, `yes`, `Yes`, `YES`, `on`, `On`, `ON`\n",
    "* False Values: `false`, `False`, `FALSE`, `no`, `No`, `NO`, `off`, `Off`, `OFF`\n",
    "\n",

    "# Standard Boolean Values\n",

    "light_switch: on  # Alternative for true\n",
    "dark_mode: off  # Alternative for false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Null (`!!null`) üåÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "Null values in YAML represent the absence of a value. They are useful for indicating missing, undefined, or unassigned data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* example\n",
